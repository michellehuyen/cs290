    <h2>Q&A!</h2>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?
    <br><strong>A:</strong> I had a little bit of trouble making my picture appear on my website and asked my friend for help. After asking my friend for help, I realized that
    I needed to copy my image onto the public_html. I knew nothing about HTML so I didn't know how to open up my website on the browser. Thanks to my friend who taught me how to pull up my website on the broweser and make my code show up on the website, I was able to complete the assignment.<br></p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
    <br><strong>A:</strong> I knew nothing about HTML so through this assignment I got to learn literally everything from how to create a website, to uploading an image to my website, to including links in my website, as well as playing around with headers and paragraphs and how to make the texts bold.<br></p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
    <br><strong>A:</strong> The 2 resources that were most helpful to me was learning HTML through Codeacademy as well as re-watching the lecture videos. I used Codeacademy to understand the
    basics of HTML because I knew absolutely nothing about the language. I also re-watched the lecture videos and got help from my friend to understand how to get all of my code to show up on my website.<br></p>
